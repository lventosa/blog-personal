**Florence Nightingale** was born in 1820 in the city after which she was named. Her parents were British and she was raised in London. Hers was a well-off family and she had access to education from a very young age. Nonetheless, wealthy women like Florence were not expected to work but rather to get married, look after the home, read, sew and attend social events.

Florence, however, felt it was her call from God to become a nurse. At that time, though, only women could become nurses, the job was not recognized as it is today, hospitals were everything but hygienic and sanitized places and most of the time nurses didn't have any training at all. But bear with me, because Florence Nightingale changed it all!

Florenced studied nursing in Germany and a few years later she was running a women's hospital in London. There, she worked to improve the working conditions and the care patients received. 

In October 1853, the **Crimean War**, which confronted the Russian Empire with an alliance made up of the United Kingdom, France, the Ottoman Empire and Sardinia and took place in the Crimean peninsula, started. Soldiers soon started dying from wounds and injuries, infectious diseases and hunger as they were not receiving the medical assistance they needed. 

In 1854, Florence and 38 other nurses trained by herself traveled to the Crimean peninsula to treat the wounded British soldiers in the Crimean War. When the team of nurses got there, they were horrified at the state and conditions of the war *hospital* where British soldiers were sent. The place was overcrowded, dirty, with broken drains and toilets, rats running around and there was not enough supply of food, blankets and medical supplies and equipment. Due to these antihygienic conditions, many soldiers died from infectious diseases and this is where Florence's work in the Crimean peninsula started to be crucial.

Not only did she purchase better medical equipment, improved overall hospital conditions as well as patient care so fewer and fewer soldiers died from infectious diseases, Nightingale wanted to bring this issue to the British Parliament. Moreover, she even helped soldiers to write letters if they were not able to and at night she would visit the wounded men to make sure they were comfortable. As she walked with a lantern in these night visits, Florence is also known as the *Lady with the Lamp*.

She had kept a record of monthly deaths by injuries, zymotic diseases and other causes among the soldiers between April 1854 and March 1856 to denounce the conditions in which she and her team found the war hospital in the Crimean peninsula. Florence represented the monthly deaths by cause in polar-area graphs, as the image below shows, which were afterwards named Nightingale rose plots in her honor.

The fact that she had collected real data and presented to government authorities to influence future political decisions based on empirical evidence makes of Florence a statistician, in a way. 

From that moment on, the British Army started training war doctors and hospital conditions were improved. Moreover, in 1860, Florence opened the **Nightingale Training School for Nurses** in St Thomas Hospital in London. Her school provided excellent nurse training and made nursing a respectable career for those women who wanted to work outside the home.

In 1907, Florence Nightingale became the first woman to ever receive the Order of Merit, an award to distinguish her service in the army and for the country. She died in 1910, at 90 years of age, and she is still remembered as the **founder of modern nursing**.
